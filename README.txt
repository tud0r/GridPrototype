**Grid Rows** 
Rows alternate from odd and even numbers to get the best visibility for each avatar. 
The grid is currently set to 4 rows with 14 slots that can be occupied with avatars. 


**Row Spacing** 
The spacing between each row has been set to the width of an avatar. This should be minimum padding space between rows for ideal visibility of each avatar in the row behind. 



**Avatars** 
Avatars currently set to 4:3 aspect ratio to match majority of web cams. Any 16:9 webcams can simply be cropped. 
Avatar width to be set to a reasonable width to comply with the camera positioning along the Z axis and insure that the avatart is displayed at a reasonable size for UI interactions. 

Current default avatar dimensions 

Avatar WIDTH  = 15px
Avatar Height = WIDTH * 0.75 (4:30 aspect ratio)
