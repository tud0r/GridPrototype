# Grid Prototype

###Grid Rows 

Rows alternate from odd and even numbers to get the best visibility for each avatar, and also form an a more organic pattern to simulate a crowd to avoid military style rows.
The grid is currently set to 4 rows with 14 slots that can be occupied with avatars.   
  

###Row Spacing  

The spacing between each row has been set to the width of an avatar. This should be the minimum padding space between rows for ideal visibility of each avatar in the row behind.  
Should the default size of the avatar width change so should the minimum row spacing change to match. 
Row Spacing = Avatar WIDTH
  
  
###Avatars 

Avatars currently set to **4:3** aspect ratio to match majority of web cams. Any 16:9 webcams can simply be cropped. 
Avatar width to be set to a reasonable width to comply with the camera positioning along the Z axis and insure that the avatart is displayed at a reasonable size for UI interactions.

Current default avatar dimensions 

Avatar **WIDTH**  = 15px  
Avatar **HEIGHT** = WIDTH * 0.75 (4:30 aspect ratio)
